let mood = 'sleepy';

if (mood === 'sleepy' && tirednessLevel > 8) {

} else {
  console.log('not bed time yet');
}

//Let’s create an if...else statement that checks if mood is 'sleepy' and tirednessLevel is greater than 8.

//If both conditions evaluate to true, then console.log() the string 'time to sleep'. Otherwise, we should console.log() 'not bed time yet'.

//After you press “Run”, play around with the || operator and the ! operator! What happens if you negate the value of the entire statement with ! 
//and switch to || instead of &&?
