let hungerLevel = 7;
//Using let, create a variable named hungerLevel and set it equal to 7.

if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log ('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log ('We can eat later!');
}
//Write an if...else statement using a comparison operator. 
//The condition should check if hungerLevel is greater than 7. If so, the conditional statement should log, 
//'Time to eat!'. Otherwise, it should log 'We can eat later!'.

//After you press run, play around with the condition by tweaking the comparison of hungerLevel by using 
//different operators such as <=,>=,>, and <.
