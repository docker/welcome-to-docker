WEB DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATIONS
PupSpa
Let’s practice what we’ve just learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, 
responsive web page. Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. 
They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every <div> appears in its own row. 
Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive. Some of the properties we’ll be using include:

display
grid-template-rows
grid-template-columns
gap
grid-column-start
grid-column-end
We’ll also cover a couple of the shorthand properties of these as well, so let’s get started!
